# JS-Calc  
## **About**  
A calculator made with HTML, CSS, and, vanilla JS. 


## **Instructions**
Create a Calculator app that calculates numbers using simple arithmetic with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

**MVP**

1. Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in your browser’s console.
    1. add
    2. subtract
    3. multiply
    4. divide  


2. Create a new function `operate` that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.  

3. Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.  

    1. Do not worry about wiring up the JS just yet.  

    2. There should also be a display for the calculator, go ahead and fill it with some dummy numbers so you can get it looking right.  

    3. Add a “clear” button.   

4. Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons… you should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.  

5. Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator, and also save which operation has been chosen and then `operate()` on them when the user presses the “=” key.  

    1. You should already have the code that can populate the display, so once `operate()` has been called, update the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation.  

    2. This is the hardest part of the project. You need to figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with them. Don’t feel bad if it takes you a while to figure out the logic.  
    
**NOTE**
 - DO NOT use or copy a ***'follow along'*** video or page.  Build everything on your own.
- Reference any material that you have used.  
- Include notes and comment on how the project was created.  
- Write about any stumbling blocks you had and how you got thorugh them.
